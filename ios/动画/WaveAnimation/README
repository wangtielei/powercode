This is an iOS project which demonstrates the usage of the SCWaveAnimationView. I had more than one project where I needed to give some visual feedback on the touches especially in conjunction with TVOut support.
Just compile and run. Then you can play with the different configuration settings of the wave animation.

The SCWaveAnimationView.m normally just uses the preprocessor defines for the different configuration values. I have introduced the global variable storage just for the sake of this demo app. I recommend you revert back to using the defines if you plan to include this in any of your projects.
