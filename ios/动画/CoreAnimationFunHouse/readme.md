# Core Animation Fun House
## Created by Brian Coyner, 2011

A suite of sample code showing how to use various aspects of the Core Animation framework

Examples include:

- Implicit animations (size, color, border, corners, etc.)
- Explicit animations (transforms)
- Animation along a path 
- BÃ©zier curve editor (with animation along a path)
- Using a `CAReplicatorLayer` and `CAGradientLayer` to create a reflection (with full sublayer animation support)
- Wiggle and jiggle (using two explicit animations)
