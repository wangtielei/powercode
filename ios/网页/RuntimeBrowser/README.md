This is a class browser for the Objective-C runtime on Mac OS X. It gives you full access to all classes loaded in the runtime; allows you to dynamically load new modules and their classes; shows every method implemented on each class; and displays information in a header (.h) file format.

We have found this to be a useful development tool. Please note, however, that each user is responsible for their own usage.

The [original version](http://www.prajnait.com/source/src_RuntimeBrowser.html) was released in April 2002 by Ezra Epstein. The project is maintained by Nicolas Seriot since August, 2008.

The Mac OS X version features:

  * browse by class tree, image or indexed list
  * search in classes contents
  * syntax colorization
  * drag and drop frameworks and headers

The iPhone OS version features:

  * browse by class tree, image or indexed list
  * search in classes names
  * headers retrieval through HTTP
  * instantiations and basic methods invocations at runtime

You can browse the [iOS headers](https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers) as seen by RuntimeBrowser.
