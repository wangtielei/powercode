To do list (ToDo.txt).
======================
    April 30, 2002

Add:

    Preferences Panel:
	Filename prefix 
	BOOL: show NSFramework_... classes
	BOOL: use typedefs for structs
  	variable names for:  arguments, categories, struct/union variables

    Find:
 	Find class by name: if the Browser is the 1st responder -- add a "Search Results" to the root array and handle it specially.  Double-click on browser: if on a Search Result(s) select the corresponding Class in its regular location in the browser (as Search Results displays classes out of their hierarchy: no sub classes, etc.)

    Save Subclasses:
	Confirm if of a root class (might be lots of classes)
	Save to a directory -- show progress

    Save All:
	Confirm (lots of classes)
	Save to a directory -- show progress

    About:
	Needs a proper About panel.

    Help:
	How to use RB.
	COPYING, etc. -- ad a help page with the GPL

    Structs:
  	Implement the typedefs && generalization (and formatting) code for structs/unions and output the structs as typedefs early in the header and reference them in other parts by name -- unique by structure of the struct (NSString uniquing -- basically a reverse dictionary with the struct def string as the key and the struct name as the value).


NOTES:

bit fields have a modified format -- implement support if we're on a system that uses the new format.

category names -- are property of a private cache...
protocols -- seem not to load on this version (NT)... try elsewhere

empty categories -- BUG? classes w/out methods show their first category methods as class methods.
